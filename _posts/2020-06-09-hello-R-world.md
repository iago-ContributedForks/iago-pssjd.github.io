title: "Hello R World"

This is my first post, a test I could do thanks to the blog entry [How to Start a Jekyll Blog on GitHub Pages for Free](https://onextrapixel.com/start-jekyll-blog-github-pages-free/).

There is more than one way to read the name of the blog. *R there solutions?* asks about:
* Are there any solutions?. If there are solutions we will show them...
* Where are the solutions? There?
* R there solutions. The solutions aRe in R.

That's the task of this blog.
